# Training
1. Data preprocessing:
    - Mount Google Drive and load necessary datasets.
    - Merge and preprocess the datasets.
    - Perform ASCII conversion on the text data.
2. Model architecture:
    - Implement a BiLSTM neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
    - Define the architecture including embedding, bidirectional LSTM layers, and output layer.
3. Train the model:
    - Compile the model with appropriate optimizer and loss function.
    - Train the model on the prepared data.
4. Save the model:
    - Save the trained model for later use.
