# Turkish Diacritization

This repository contains the code and resources for the Turkish Diacritization project. 

## Overview

To understand a person, it is necessary to understand the language they speak. Accent marks are vital for fully understanding the language, and failure to understand these signs correctly may lead to uncertainty. This project focuses on creating a Turkish diacritization model using deep learning. By predicting and adding diacritics, we aim to improve text clarity for better natural language processing applications.
